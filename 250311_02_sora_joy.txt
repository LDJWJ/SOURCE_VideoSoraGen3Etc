🎬 Video Script for Sora – "Hope Grows After Hardship"
[1. Opening Scene – Dark & Rainy Atmosphere]
🌧️ A lone figure (a child, a person, or even a small animal) walks slowly down a quiet street in the rain.
💧 Raindrops fall gently, puddles ripple, and the sky is gray.
🌿 A tiny sprout struggles to grow in the cracks of the sidewalk.
📜 Soft, handwritten text appears: "Any hardship will pass, and from it, joy can grow."

[2. Transition – The Storm Begins to Clear]
🌦️ The rain slows, and the clouds start to part. A warm light peeks through the sky.
👣 The figure pauses and notices the tiny sprout, bending down to touch it gently.
🎶 Soft, hopeful music begins to play, shifting the mood.

[3. The Growth – A Symbol of Resilience]
☀️ Sunlight bathes the sprout, and it begins to grow stronger.
🌸 Flowers bloom around it, and nature starts to awaken.
😌 The figure smiles, taking a deep breath, feeling relief and hope.

[4. Final Scene – A Bright, Warm Future]
🌈 The sky is now blue, birds fly freely, and people or animals are seen enjoying the world again.
🤝 The figure helps someone else, passing on kindness.
📜 Final text appears: "Believe in the joy that will bloom after hardships."

🎶 Music swells as the camera zooms out, showing a world filled with light and hope.
